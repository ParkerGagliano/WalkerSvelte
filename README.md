# Walker

Code for [Walker](https://walker.parkergagliano.com), a walktime and drivetime calculator for my local area. This project uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [ObjectionJS](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/) and the [Google Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/overview) to check the destination address against all the public beach accesses.

On top of the calculator, you can create an account in order to save your specific queries with custom session management, storage, etc.

This is my first project I made after learning svelte and sveltekit and has helped solidify my knowledge
